    <h2>Fimal-Term Information & Revision Tips</h2>
    <h3>Exam Date</h3>
    <p>
        TBD, will be between Jan 13 - Jan 16.
    </p>
    <h3>Revision Tips</h3>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Unit 1: Atomic Structure, Bonding, and Periodic Trends in Chemistry</li>
            <li>Unit 2: Metals, Reactivity, and Electrolysis</li>
            <li>Unit 3: Chemical & Quantitative Analysis</li>
        </ul>
        The exam will cover the above mentioned units. I strongly recommend you review the following points:
        <ul>
            <li>Periodic Trends</li>
            <li>Atomic Structure & Bondings</li>
            <li>⭐️Reactivities of Metals</li>
            <li>⭐️Electrolysis & Electroplate</li>
            <ul>
                <li>⭐️Electrolysis of some Common Solutions</li>
                <li>⭐️Reactivities of Elements on Anode and Cathode</li>
            </ul>
            <li>⭐️Acids and Bases</li>
            <ul>
                <li>⭐️Calculate the unknow concentration by the reaction with acid and base</li>
                <li>⭐️Simple Acid and Base/Metal Oxide</li>
                <li>Indicators</li>
                <li>pH</li>
            </ul>
            <li>⭐️Moles</li>
            <ul>
                <li>⭐️Calculations of moles from reactions</li>
                <li>⭐️Mole Ratios</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <p>
            These points have been discussed in class and are relatively obscure and difficult to understand, or they are easy-to-make mistakes in the last Mid-Term exam.
            <br>I  hope everyone can achieve good results after reviewing these points!
