# IG Chemistry

## Final-Term Information & Revision Tips

### Exam Date
TBD, will be between Jan 13 - Jan 16.

### Revision Tips
- Unit 1: Atomic Structure, Bonding, and Periodic Trends in Chemistry
- Unit 2: Metals, Reactivity, and Electrolysis
- Unit 3: Chemical & Quantitative Analysis

The exam will cover the above mentioned units. I strongly recommend you review the following points:
- Periodic Trends
- Atomic Structure & Bondings
- ⭐️Reactivities of Metals
- ⭐️Electrolysis & Electroplate
    - ⭐️Electrolysis of some Common Solutions
    - ⭐️Reactivities of Elements on Anode and Cathode
- ⭐️Acids and Bases
    - ⭐️Calculate the unknown concentration by the reaction with acid and base
    - ⭐️Simple Acid and Base/Metal Oxide
    - Indicators
    - pH
- ⭐️Moles
    - ⭐️Calculations of moles from reactions
    - ⭐️Mole Ratios

These points have been discussed in class and are relatively obscure and difficult to understand, or they are easy-to-make mistakes in the last Mid-Term exam.  
I hope everyone can achieve good results after reviewing these points!
